## STA5065Z Machine Learning

Machine learning from a statistical learning theory perspective, detailing the mathematics of how & why learning & concept discovery is possible. Based largly on the course by Abu-Mostafa (https://work.caltech.edu/), topics include:

- The Learning Problem: Mathematics of Learning 
- Neural Networks
- Regularization & Validation
- Linear Dimensionality Reduction
- Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction 
- Fast Fourier Transforms & Wavelets
- SVM: Support Vector Machines
- Cross Validation
